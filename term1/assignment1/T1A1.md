## Q2
**Packets**: In computer networking, packets are used to break large amounts of information being sent over a network into smaller pieces or "packets". The reason for this is that if information were sent as a whole, it would slow the network down significantly. By using this system, individual packets are sent separately, each being routed to their destination by various routers and switches. When the packets arrive at their destination, they are re-assembled by the receiving computer to be displayed on screen or used for the intended purpose.

**IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)**:
IP stands for internet protocol. IP addresses were created to provide an address for any computer or device that is connected to a computer network. It serves as that device's address on the internet. IP version 4 (IPv4) was the original format used for IP addresses. IPv4 provides addresses as a 32-bit number in the format of 4 fields, each separated by a dot (.).

As the internet grew, the number of available addresses in IPv4 became limited, so Ipv6 (IP Version 6) came into effect. These addresses are in hexadecimal format of 128 bits, comprising 8 fields separated by a colon (:). The benefits of IPv6 compared with IPv4 are:

1. Providing vastly more available addresses
1. Providing integrated security measures meaning Ipv6 addresses are less susceptible to attacks.

**Routers and routing**: Routers are devices that 'route' packets from one place to another. There are home routers which receive data via a modem and then 'forward' it onto whichever device (computer, phone, television etc) connected to the network, that has requested the data. This process exists on a larger scale enabling data packets to be transferred from one router to another until it reaches its intended destination. Each packet has information contained within it specifying its destination. Routers will use routing tables to determine the best route, similar to physical route planning in a car using maps and the road network. It might be that the shortest route is impacted by a traffic jam; a router will look for a diversion, which may be a longer route but will ultimately be more efficient than the impacted usual route. 

Routing Tables automatic/static: There is a system where the routers are able to gain information about the length of time the routes are taking and make adjustments to standard routes when required. [*Further research required*]

**Domains and DNS**: Domains are the addresses of web pages. In their original form, they are a collection of numbers which are interpreted by computers. In order to make this easier for humans, the Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced. This provides a human-friendly name which corresponds to each web page, meaning users are able to enter [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) into their browser's address bar, instead of needing to know the Google page's true domain.
