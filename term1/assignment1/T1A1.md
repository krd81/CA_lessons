Packets: In computer networking, packets are used to break large amounts of information being sent over a network into smaller pieces or "packets". The reason for this is that if information were sent as a whole, it would slow the network down significantly. By using this system, individual packets are sent separately, each being routed to their destination by various routers and switches. When the packets arrive at their destination, they are re-assembled by the receiving computer to be displayed on screen or used for the intended purpose.

Available at: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/how-does-the-internet-work/ (Accessed: 18 September 2023). n networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Each packet contains both data and information about that data. The information about the packet's contents is known as the "header," and it goes at the front of the packet so that the receiving machine knows what to do with the packet. To understand the purpose of a packet header, think of how some consumer products come with assembly instructions.

When data gets sent over the Internet, it is first broken up into smaller packets, which are then translated into bits. The packets get routed to their destination by various networking devices such as routers and switches. When the packets arrive at their destination, the receiving device reassembles the packets in order and can then use or display the data.


IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
IP stands for internet protocol. IP addresses were created to provide an address for any computer or device that is connected to a computer network. It serves as that device's address on the internet. IP version 4 (IPv4) was the original format used for IP addresses. IPv4 provides addresses as a 32-bit number in the format of 4 fields, each separated by a dot (.).

As the internet grew, the number of available addresses in Ipv4 became limited, so Ipv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) came into effect. These addresses are in hexadecimal format of 128 bits, comprising 8 fields separated by a colon (:). The benefits of IPv6 compared with IPv4 are:

1. Providing vastly more available addresses
1. Providing integrated security measures meaning Ipv6 addresses are less susceptible to attacks.
